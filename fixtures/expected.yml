Therefore, we are seeking 9B certification for the currently leased area (Tenancy 9:4 and 9:5) marked in the floor plan and Tenancy 9:1 which we are prospecting to lease in near future.

    As we are a small business, please consider approval of 9B without any modifications to the existing building.
